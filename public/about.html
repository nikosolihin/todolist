<h3>Homework 8</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What server framework are you using?</strong></p>

<p>For the server I am using <em>express</em>, a web application framework for node.js.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it programmatic or template-based?</strong></p>

<p><em>Express</em> is more programmatic out of the box, but there are a few template engines that can be paired with it. Furthermore, <em>express</em> makes no assumption in terms of your application structure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On a scale of 1-5 (1=easy), rate the learning curve of your chosen framework.     Justify your answer.</strong></p>

<p>I would say that the learning curve of <em>express</em> is 2. It is a very lean framework that provides basic RESTful routing interface out of the box.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>On a scale of 1-5 (1=easy), rate the difficulty of converting your app to the     framework. Justify your answer.</strong></p>

<p>Converting my app to the backend framework was not too difficult, 2 out of 5. However, since <em>express</em> has no notion of a database, I went through some trial and errors setting up a third-party node module to interface with my MongoDB database at nodejitsu. Additionally, since <em>express</em> has no notion of application design pattern, most of my time was spent doing the frontend logic using <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Would you consider using the framework again?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I would. I like the simplistic nature of <em>express</em> and the fact that it is a RESTful framework.</p></li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Homework 9</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>How is your server implemented? RESTfully or Web Services?</strong></p>

<p>RESTfully using <em>express</em> as described above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If it’s RESTful, provide the following information:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Resource identification - what are the resource abstractions?</em></p>

<p>The resource is <em>only</em> the tasks in the To-Do List.</p></li>
<li><p><em>URI design - what do your URIs look like?</em></p>

<pre><code>Retreive all tasks:
GET http://cis658-todolist.nodejitsu.com/tasks

Retreive task with ID#:
GET http://cis658-todolist.nodejitsu.com/tasks/:id

Creating a new tasks:
POST http://cis658-todolist.nodejitsu.com/tasks

    With request body:    
    {
        "name": "Study for exam"
    }

Updating the status of task with ID#:
PUT http://cis658-todolist.nodejitsu.com/tasks/:id

    With request body:    
    {
        "name": "Study more",
        "status": "completed"
    }

Deleting a task with ID#:
DELETE http://cis658-todolist.nodejitsu.com/tasks/:id
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><em>Interaction semantics - do all four HTTP verbs apply to all resources?</em></p>

<p>Yes. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE apply.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Resource relationships - how are resources linked?</em></p>

<p>The resources are not linked since this is a very simple application.  However, if the application has the capability of handling different users, there will be "state transfer" links/relationships between tasks and the users resource abstraction.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data representation - XML, JSON, etc.</em></p>

<p>JSON.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Did you use a framework? If so, which one?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. <em>Express</em> as described in homework 8.</p></li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Homework 10</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Which PaaS provider did you choose for your application (if it’s not obvious from   the URL)?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nodejitsu.com/">NodeJitsu</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What was the most challenging aspect of the transition to a cloud-based platform?</strong></p>

<p>For me, it was getting node to communicate with Nodejitsu's MongoDB, but it was probably because I have not done much with MongoDB before.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Did your PaaS provide make writing the code any easier, for example by providing  useful utility APIs?</strong></p>

<p>Although not necessarily utility API, I did find nodejitsu's CLI to be quite helpful for deploying and debugging my application.</p></li>
